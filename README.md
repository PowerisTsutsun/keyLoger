# 🔐 Educational Keylogger – Python (Windows)

> ⚠️ **For educational and ethical use only.** Do not use this tool on systems you do not own or without explicit permission.

This project demonstrates how a basic keylogger works using Python. It logs user keystrokes to a local file along with timestamps and the currently active window title. It is intended for **cybersecurity students and enthusiasts** to understand how keylogging works and to develop better defenses against such attacks.

## 📌 Features

- Logs every key pressed
- Records the timestamp of each keystroke
- Tracks the title of the currently active window (e.g., Notepad, Chrome)
- Hides the console window (for stealth)
- Clean and simple code using `pynput`
